# Engineering-Notebooks-FTC
Collection of the Engineering Notebooks I redacted as part of my highschool robotics team in FTC.

These are 2 pdfs showcasing the engeneering notebooks for the First Tech Challenge Romania robotics competition
that I took part in as a member of the team RO044 Circuit Dealerz. They are named accordingly, one is for the 2018 season and one
for the 2019 season. In 2018 we managed to win the Connect Award 2nd place and Judge's Award 1st place in the Bucharest national phase,
awards which directly linked to the notebook. In 2019 we managed to win the Motivate Award 1st place in the Iasi regional phase.
